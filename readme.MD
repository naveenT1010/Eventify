Introduction
=====================================================================================

Everyday we are bombarded with loads of webmail for events and expecting us to be 
normal active IITian (I smell sarcasm there) we really dont care to note any of that.
Rather  we just forget the event and miss a multitude of opportunites which could otherwise help us in many a ways.

Welcome to Eventify, the complete solution for all events related hassles which at its core is based upon webmail and real time event creation and notifications with just a single click. Eventify also has you class tiem table and basic schedule out of the box.

This project contains two nodes. One is chrome extension and other is an android app.
The extension catures all the necessary information form mails that have date, time, topic and venue in them. Then this extension sends off the data into cloud with which our app is in contant connection in real time without the used needing to press any refresh key (goodbye old day..).

Usage
=======================================================================================
IMP INFO: Currently sever has values for only 2 names: aman and sandeep. Use only these names in extension communnication as well as in app registration. There is scope for any generic name but due to time constraints we could do this much only. SO THERE IS NO NEED TO REGISTER. USE FOLLOWING CREDENTIALS TO LOGIN in APP:

	your name 
	your username
	
	ex: 
	    John Doe
	    john.doe

1. Using Eventify is like a child's play, even your cat can do it. You just need to install the app in your android phone and install the Chrome Extension. 

2. After installing the app, register by entering webmail and Name(same name to be used in extension communication). This will get your time table also.

3. The only factor you have to keep in mind that everytime sending the data from extension, you need to WRITE THE NAME THE SAME  WAY YOU DID DURING APP REGISTRATION.
To get your time table, just enter your webmail to get the stuff on the fly.

4. Coming to extension, this is very specific and may not work in all mails. 

5. Just open your mail and click on extention to see if it filled the last 4 fields as you changing them doesnt work. (under developement)

6. Always see that all the fields are filled before sending by itself.

7. The only bug till now is that changing the fields other than Name wouldnt do any effect. Thats why always see that last 4 fields are filled by extension, if not this will not work in that particular mail.
